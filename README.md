# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering. It is a classic machine learning task where unsupervised learning techniques are applied to identify distinct groups within a customer dataset based on purchasing behavior and demographic data.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

• Python

• Pandas & NumPy

• Matplotlib & Seaborn

• Scikit-learn

 # 📊 Workflow Overview
 
• Data Importing: Load and preview the dataset.

• Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize distributions and relationships in the data.

• Preprocessing: Normalize features using StandardScaler.

# K-Means Clustering:

• Apply the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

• Fit and visualize the clusters.

• Insights: Interpret results for marketing or business strategy.

# 📈 Output
• Cluster plots

• Insights into customer segmentation based on features like Annual Income and Spending Score.
